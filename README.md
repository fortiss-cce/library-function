# Library System - Review

This is the code for a very simple library system.
The system contains books (``library.model.book``) with their respective authors (``library.model.author``) and publishers (``library.model.publisher``). There are 3 types of books: Paper, Digital and Audio books.

There is a library class (``library.py``) that prints the longest crime audio book.
